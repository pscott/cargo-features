# cargo-features

## A CLI tool to monitor your features
use `cargo run PATH` to run find the hidden features inside `PATH`.
Say I wish to find the hidden features inside `~/my-projects`, I just run `cargo run ~/my-projects`!

Easy peasy

## Soonâ„¢
Use this tool in your CI to make sure you have no hidden feature :)
