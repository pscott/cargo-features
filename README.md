# cargo-features
## Install
To start using this tool, you must first install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
Then clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pscott/cargo-features.git ; cd cargo-features;
```

## A CLI tool to monitor your features
use `cargo run PATH` to run find the hidden features inside `PATH`.
Say I wish to find the hidden features inside `~/my-projects`, I just run `cargo run ~/my-projects`!

Easy peasy
